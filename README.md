# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, take a seat! :seat:

This account is a place to share my thoughts ðŸ’­, projects, ideas ðŸ’¡, and knowledge ðŸ“š on topics related to Data Science and Programming ðŸ’» in general. I aim to keep it well-organized to make it easy to find whatever topic you're interested in. Each repository is designated to a topic related to the Data Ecosystem (Data Science, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis), containing projects I've worked on, notes, and other useful resources. Currently, there are three main repositories covering different topics:
1. [Data-Engineering](https://github.com/abdo1327/Data-engineering-): This repository contains some of the projects I've worked on under the Data Engineering umbrella, such as ETL, pipelines, database abstraction, and management. The projects showcase the usage of a list of tools and how they are utilized in the field of Data Engineering.
2. [Data-Science-and-AI](https://github.com/abdo1327/Data-Science-and-AI): This repository is where the main Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects reside. It includes various projects covering topics such as AI, ML algorithms, computer vision, NLP, deep learning, and more.
3. [Data-Analysis-and-Business-Intelligence](https://github.com/abdo1327/Data-Analysis-and-Business-Intelligence-Analysis): This repository is intended to contain projects that demonstrate end-to-end data analysis in action and how data analysis can be used to make data-driven business decisions. It covers many concepts such as data visualization, EDA, statistical analysis, data analysis with social sciences, and much more. Most of the projects I work on as a BI analyst cannot be shared due to privacy constraints. However, I've worked on numerous BI projects such as:
    - Top management KPIs
    - Churn Analysis model
    - Predictive Sales Model
    - Cohort Analysis Model
    - Cross-Sell And Upsell Model
    - Customer Engagement Model
    - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
    - Customer Feedback Model
    - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Model
    - Customer Profitability Model
    - Customer-segmentation model
    - Inventory Optimization model
    - Lead Score Model
    - Marketing Mix Model (MMM)
    - Market segmentation model
    
There are many other projects that I've worked on but haven't uploaded either because they contain clients' data or I no longer have access to the projects.
